This repository contains the code and 3D models required to build the Voice-Enabled Video Game Controller. Read the full project description and build tutorial on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/rhammell/voice-enabled-video-game-controller-c76200).

## Project Description
The voice-enabled video game controller serves as an input device for computer-based video games, allowing users to play games using their voice.

In addition to traditional inputs like a joystick and buttons, the controller recognizes voice commands through its onboard microphone and voice recognition components. A built-in OLED display provides visual feedback for recognized commands. 

When connected to a computer via USB, the controller emulates a keyboard, transmitting specific keystrokes for joystick movements, button presses, and voice commands. Users can customize keystroke mapping within the controller's software for a personalized setup independent of any game.
